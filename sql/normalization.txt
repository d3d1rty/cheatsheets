normalizing databases- evaluating and correcting table structures to minimize data redundancies

normal forms: 1nf, 2nf, 3nf

pg 193 table 6-1

1nf- primary key defined, primary key not null, no multi-value cells

partial dependency when field name depends on one part of primary key
transitive dependency nonkey field depends on another non key field

2nf- 1nf with no partial dependencies

to convert from 1nf to 2nf:
determine primary keys
indentify dependencies
make new tables

3nf- 2nf with no transitive dependencies

atomicity- reducing an attribute to multiple fields of reduced complexity
